Alteration Principles

Modification: Amplification and attenuation. Strengthen skin to be as hard as iron or weaken an enemy's resistance to magic.
Construct: Form magic into a temporary construct: an orb of light, ash to entomb an enemy, or a wall of stone.
Force: Displace and suspend entities, or manipulate objects such as locks.
Abstract: Alter the rules of reality. Teleport, slow time, breathe water, transmute metals, or sense the proximity of living and dead minds.



Conjuration Principles

Daedric: Banish or summon Daedra and bind them to your will.
Necromantic: Bind undead creatures and reanimate bodies.
Spirit: Summon and transport spirits and their vessels across space and time.
Bindings: Summon weapons from Oblivion and trap the energy of souls upon death.



Destruction Principles

Fire: Channel magicka into fire.
Frost: Channel magicka into frost.
Shock: Channel magicka into lightning.
Unaspected: Harm, weaken, or absorb life from an enemy with non-elemental magical energy.



Illusion Principles

Concealing: Render yourself and others invisible and inaudible.
Overwhelming: Control the emotions and actions of others to generate a false calm, aggression, or fear.
Projection: Alter perceptions of the world strongly enough to directly assist or harm allies and enemies.
Arcane: Use arcane energy to divine a path to your objective, dispel lingering magical effects, or retrieve information from an enemy's mind.



Restoration Principles

Righteous: Channel magicka into searing light inimical to the undead, or aid in the pursuit of justice.
Defensive: Reduce and redirect physical and magical harm.
Curing: Repair damage to both the living and undead.
Consuming: Cast spells with entropic magical energy that harms the living.
